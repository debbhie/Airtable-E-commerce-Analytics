# End-to-End Supermarket Operations & SLA Analytics (Airtable)

## Project Overview
This project uses a supermarket transaction dataset to design an end-to-end order fulfillment and SLA monitoring system in Airtable.
The goal was to transform flat historical sales data into a scalable operational workflow that tracks order delivery performance, customer value, and service-level agreement (SLA) compliance using data modeling, automation, and dashboards.

## Data Source
The dataset was obtained from a publicly available supermarket sales dataset, representing historical point-of-sale transactions.
The data includes order details, product categories, payment information, customer attributes, and transaction dates.

## Data Modeling & System Design
The original flat dataset was restructured into a relational data model to support analytics, automation, and scalability.
* Core Tables
- Customers
- Orders
- Products
- Order Items (bridge table)

Relationships
- The Orders table is linked to the Customers table to enable customer-level analytics.
- The Orders table is linked to the Products table through an Order Items table, creating a proper many-to-many relationship.
- Supporting fields and rollups were created to ensure accurate aggregation across tables.

## Key Fields & Metrics
** Orders Table
- Days to Deliver – Calculates how long it took to deliver an order.
- Fulfillment Status – Tracks order progress (Pending, Packed, Shipped, Delivered, Failed).
- SLA Target (Days) – The promised delivery timeframe.
- SLA Met – Indicates whether the supermarket met the SLA.
- SLA Breach – Flags orders that missed the SLA.

** Customers Table
- Order Count – Total number of orders per customer.
- Lifetime Value (LTV) – Total revenue generated by each customer.
- Average Order Value (AOV) – Average spend per order.
- Customer Segment – Categorizes customers as High, Standard, or Low value based on spend and order frequency.

** Order Items Table
- Line Revenue
- Line Cost
- Line Margin
These fields enable accurate revenue and margin calculations while linking products to individual orders.

## Problem Statements
This project was designed to answer the following business questions:
* Who are the supermarket’s high-value and repeat customers?
* Is the supermarket meeting its delivery SLA commitments?
* Where do delivery delays and SLA breaches occur?
* How can the order fulfillment workflow be automated?
* What is the supermarket’s monthly revenue performance?

## Automations Implemented
(Order Fulfillment & SLA Monitoring)
To simulate a real-world supermarket operations workflow, multiple event-driven automations were implemented in Airtable. These automations manage order progression, delivery tracking, and SLA breach detection using conditional triggers and record updates.

🔁 Automation 1: Payment → Fulfillment Order
* Trigger:
 - When a record matches conditions
* Order Status = Paid
 - Actions:
* Update Fulfillment Status to Pending
  - Record payment confirmation by updating the relevant payment field/date

* Purpose:
This automation ensures that once an order is paid, it immediately enters the fulfillment pipeline without manual intervention.

🚚 Automation 2: Shipment Update
* Trigger:
 - When a record matches conditions
* Fulfillment Status = Shipped
- Actions:
* Update the order record to reflect shipment status
 - Capture shipment-related information (e.g., shipment date)

* Purpose:
This step simulates the logistics process by automatically recording when an order leaves the warehouse and enters transit.

📦 Automation 3: Delivery Completion
* Trigger:
 - When a record matches conditions
* Fulfillment Status = Delivered
 - Actions:
* Update the order record to confirm delivery
 - Mark the order as completed

* Purpose:
This automation closes the order lifecycle, ensuring delivery events are consistently recorded and downstream metrics (such as delivery duration and SLA performance) are updated.

⚠️ Automation 4: SLA Breach Alert
* Trigger:
 - When a record matches conditions
* SLA Met ≠ Yes (i.e., SLA not met)
 - Actions:
* Automatically check the SLA Breach flag on the order record

Purpose:
This automation identifies and flags orders that exceed the agreed SLA delivery timeframe, enabling quick visibility into operational failures and supporting SLA performance analysis.

### Why These Automations Matter
Together, these automations demonstrate the ability to:
* Design event-based workflows
* Separate operational state from analytical logic
* Handle historical (backdated) data correctly
* Automate repetitive operational tasks
* Support SLA tracking and performance monitoring at scale

## Dashboard (Airtable Interface)
To support different stakeholders, three dashboards were designed using Airtable Interfaces, each focused on a specific business function: executive oversight, operations monitoring, and customer analytics.

* Order / Executive Dashboard
Purpose:
Provide leadership with a high-level view of performance across orders, revenue, and service delivery.

* Key Components:
 - Total Number of Orders – KPI card showing overall order volume.
 - Orders by Fulfillment Status – Pie chart highlighting the distribution of Pending, Packed, Shipped, and Delivered orders.
 - Total Revenue by Month – Bar chart showing revenue trends across months (Jan–Mar 2019).
 - SLA Performance – Bar chart comparing orders where SLA was met versus not applicable.

* Business Value:
 - Enables executives to quickly assess operational scale.
 - Identifies revenue trends over time.
 - Provides a snapshot of SLA compliance without operational detail overload.

* Operations Dashboard
Purpose:
Help operations and fulfillment teams monitor delivery performance and identify bottlenecks.

* Key Components:
 - SLA Breach by Fulfillment Status – Bar chart showing how SLA breaches vary across fulfillment stages.
 - Delayed Deliveries – Bar chart comparing delivery delays against SLA targets (5, 10, 20, 30 days).
 - Order Status vs Payment Method (Pivot Table) – Breakdown of payment methods (E-wallet, Cash, Credit Card) for paid orders.

* Business Value:
 - Highlights where SLA breaches are concentrated.
 - Helps operations teams focus on stages causing the most delays.
 - Supports payment-method analysis for operational planning.

* Customer Dashboard
Purpose:
Provide insights into customer value and purchasing behavior.

* Key Components:
 - High-Value Customers – Pie chart showing the distribution of customers by segment (High, Standard, Low value).
 - Repeat Buyers – Bar chart identifying customers with multiple purchases.

* Business Value:
 - Reveals that a small percentage of customers contribute the majority of revenue.
 - Supports targeted retention and loyalty strategies.
 - Enables segmentation-based decision making.

## Key Insights

* Customer revenue is highly concentrated
A small percentage of customers (high-value segment) contribute the majority of total revenue, indicating strong revenue concentration and the importance of retention strategies.

* Most orders meet SLA, but breaches cluster at specific stages
While overall SLA performance is positive, breaches are concentrated around specific fulfillment stages, suggesting operational bottlenecks rather than systemic failure.

* Longer delivery timelines significantly increase SLA risk
Orders with extended delivery durations show a higher likelihood of missing SLA targets, highlighting the impact of logistics delays on service performance.

* Repeat buyers drive stability
Customers with multiple orders provide consistent revenue and are more likely to fall into higher-value segments, reinforcing the importance of loyalty and repeat purchase programs.

* Revenue trends vary by month
Monthly revenue shows fluctuations, suggesting potential seasonality or operational constraints impacting order volume and fulfillment capacity.

## Recommendations

* Prioritize high-value customers in fulfillment workflows
Fast-track fulfillment for high-value and repeat customers to improve retention and maximize lifetime value.

* Investigate fulfillment stages with the highest SLA breaches
Focus process improvement efforts on stages where SLA breaches are most frequent, such as packing or shipping delays.

* Set realistic SLA targets based on historical performance
Use observed delivery timelines to recalibrate SLA targets, balancing customer expectations with operational capacity.

* Introduce proactive SLA alerts
Extend automation to flag orders before SLA deadlines are missed, enabling corrective action rather than reactive responses.

* Leverage dashboards for continuous monitoring
Encourage operational teams to use dashboards daily to monitor delays, while executives use high-level KPIs to guide strategic decisions.
